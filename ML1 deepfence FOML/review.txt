Project Title:
Network Traffic Classification using Flow-based Features

Goal:
To build a machine learning model that can distinguish between malicious and benign network traffic based on flow statistics, and evaluate its performance using a confusion matrix and other metrics.

Structure:

│       └── 2017-05-02_kali-normal22_flow_stats.csv <- Benign traffic data

Environment Setup:

	Created a virtual environment:
		*VENV

Installed required packages:
	pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Data Loading:
*Loaded two CSV files: one for malicious traffic (webgoat) and one for benign traffic (kali).

*Added a new column Type to indicate traffic type (Benign or Malicious).

*Combined both datasets and shuffled the rows randomly for training purposes.

Feature Engineering:
	flowDuration

Data Cleaning:
	Removed NaN, inf, -inf values.

	Converted the dataset into X (features) and y (labels).

	Ensured all features are numeric and labels are either "Benign" or "Malicious".
